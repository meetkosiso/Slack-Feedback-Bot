## Wrap-up Questions and Answers

#### How long did this take?

It took 4 hours.

### What did you learn in this challenge?

I learnt how to build a bot on slack framework using Slack block kit. It
was my first time building a bot on slack framework.

### What was a challenging decision you made and what alternatives did you consider?

I considered using Slack block kit directly or a third party wrapper like slack-block-builder, I chose to use slack-block-builder because it abstracts most of slack block kit implementation and it offers better readability.

### What improvements you would make to the code base? (best practices, architecture, etc.)

Add more details to README and Cover more test cases.

### How would you make it faster to iterate on the app? (i.e. deployment)

Setup a CI-CD pipeline to run test, build and deploy after every pull request is approved.

### If you had more time, what would you have done?

Create a success page that is triggered after every successful submission.
